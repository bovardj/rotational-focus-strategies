## [RFS - Rotational Focus Strategies](https://www.focusapp.dev)

This is a web app for using rotational focus strategies (RFS) as a means of supporting users with ADHD. This was developed as a course project at the University of Utah in the spring of 2025. 

#### The main stages for this project are:
1. Sign up and RFS selection
2. Baseline data gathering
3. Daily RFS use and surveys
4. Exit survey

### Available Focus Strategies

#### Background Sound

Work with sounds in the background. This should strike a balance that may help you to focus on your work while not being too distracting. Some suggestions (some with external links) are:

Ambient sounds
- [White noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2XyqC-EQ4&t=40s)
- [Brown noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P48QELwruQs)
- [Nature sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipf7ifVSeDU)
- Instrumental music
- [Lo-fi beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk)
- Classical music

You can also try to find a playlist that is specifically designed for studying or working. These playlists often have a mix of different types of music and sounds that can help you to focus.

Some people even find that having a TV show on in the background can help them focus. If you are one of those people, try to find a show that you have already seen so that it does not distract you too much. You can also try to find a show that is not too engaging, so that you can still focus on your work.

#### Check List

A checklist is a great way to keep track of your progress and make sure that you are completing all of the tasks that you need to do. You can use a physical checklist or a digital one, depending on your preference. Some people find that having a physical checklist helps them to stay focused, while others prefer to use a digital one because it is more convenient.

You can create a checklist for each task that you need to complete, or you can create a master checklist that includes all of the tasks that you need to do. If you are using a digital checklist, you can also set reminders for each task so that you do not forget to do them.

#### Chunking

Chunking is a technique that involves breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. This can help you to stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the overall task.

You can use chunking to break down any task, whether it is a large project or a small one. For example, if you are working on a large project, you can break it down into smaller chunks, such as research, writing, and editing. This will help you to stay focused and make progress on the project without feeling overwhelmed.

You can also use chunking to break down smaller tasks into even smaller ones. For example, if you are writing a paper, you can break it down into smaller tasks, such as writing the introduction, writing different parts of the body, and writing the conclusion. This will help you to stay focused and make progress on the paper without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Environmental Shift

An environmental shift is a technique that involves changing your environment to help you focus. This can be as simple as moving to a different room or changing the lighting in your workspace. You can also try to find a quiet place to work, such as a library or a coffee shop.

You can also try to find a place that is free from distractions, such as your phone or television. This will help you to stay focused and avoid getting distracted by things that are going on around you.

#### Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves working in short bursts of time, followed by short breaks. This can help you to stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the task at hand.

You can use a timer to set a specific amount of time for each work session, such as 25 minutes, followed by a short break of 5 minutes. After four work sessions, you can take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.

#### Small Rewards

Small rewards are a great way to motivate yourself to complete tasks. You can use small rewards to help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the task at hand. For example, if you are working on a large project, you can reward yourself with a small treat or a short break after completing each task.

You can also use small rewards to help you stay focused on smaller tasks. For example, if you are writing a paper, you can reward yourself with a small treat or a short break after completing each section of the paper.

#### Task Switching

Task switching is a technique that involves switching between different tasks to help you stay focused. It can act as a kind of mental break from a task that you may be struggling with, helping you to avoid feeling overwhelmed while still making progress on things you need to do.

For example, if you are working on a project and get stuck on one part, you can switch to another part of the project or a different task entirely (i.e. perhaps cleaning dishes). This can help refresh your mind and provide new perspectives on a task you may have been struggling with.

#### Work Partners

Work partners are a great way to stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed by a task. This doesn't necessarily mean working with someone else, but rather working nearby to someone else who is also working on a task. Along with individuals, it can also be a group of people who are working independently on different tasks, but are in the same space.
